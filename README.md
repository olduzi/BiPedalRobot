For my project I wanted to create an arduino kit that was specifically marketed to girls. I was inspired by the robot Chip-E because its a bipedal robot that waddles. I thought that if I could make it a penguin some girls would be interested in building it. Then they would use simple block programming to make it walk through a maze.

My project didn't accomplish the goal that I had in mind because I wasn't able to control my robot. Most of my time was spent 3D printing, so I didn't spend the time I wanted to program it. The look of the robot also needs work because I haven't printed out a beak or wings yet. Once I do that I hope it looks more penguin like. 

If I could redo my project, I would have gotten the same servos as Chip-E to minimize the amount of 3D printing that I had to do. However I am glad that I was able to get experience 3D modeling and hope to build upon this skill in the future.
